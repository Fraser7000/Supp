Super Pads helps manage samples on a SP-404SX. Open the app, select a SD Card root directory and adjust parameters and drag and drop files to be converted to wave with [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) behind the scenes.

Makes use of two libraries I wrote to play with my own SP-404SX, [uttori-audio-padinfo](https://github.com/uttori/uttori-audio-padinfo) for parsing and writing the `PAD_INFO.BIN` file and [uttori-audio-wave](https://github.com/uttori/uttori-audio-wave) for adding the `RLND` header to the Wave files out of FFmpeg, and an Electron wrapper to make it easier to use.

_Note:_ I do not have an OG SP-404 or SP-404A but this could easily support those if someone is willing to help debug issues.

If you would like to suggest something or have found an issue please file a bug or message me on Twitter [@superfamicom](https://twitter.com/superfamicom).

## Roadmap

Features I have planned to work on as time permits and there are others using the app. Roughly in order:

- Copy & Paste between pads to move one pad to another or copy one pad to another.
- Investigate alternatives to Electron like [Tauri](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri).
- Saved Sets for easier and fast switching of arrangements.
- Preview sounds.
